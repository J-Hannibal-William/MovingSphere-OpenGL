# MovingSphere-OpenGL
This project renders a moving and rotating sphere with realistic lighting and shadow effects using OpenGL in Python. The sphere moves along the x-axis while rotating, with a semi-transparent shadow beneath it. The animation runs smoothly at ~60 FPS using GLUT for rendering and timing.
