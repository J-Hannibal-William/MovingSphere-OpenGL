# Moving Sphere with Shadows (OpenGL)  

## Description  
This project visualizes a **moving and rotating sphere** with realistic **shadows and lighting** using OpenGL in Python. The sphere moves back and forth along the x-axis while rotating, and a semi-transparent shadow appears on the ground to simulate real-world effects.

## Features  
- **Real-time animation** (~60 FPS)
- **Lighting and shading** for a realistic effect
- **Dynamic movement** with automatic direction reversal
- **Shadow projection** to improve visual appeal  

## Installation  

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:  

```bash
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate numpy
